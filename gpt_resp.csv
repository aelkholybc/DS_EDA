It sickened nearly 9 million children and killed 136,00, mostly in poorer countries, according to a new report from WHO and the CDC.NYTLONDON (AP) — Measles deaths globally spiked by more than 40 percent last year, and cases rose after vaccination levels dramatically dropped during the pandemic, leading health agencies said Thursday.The highly infectious disease triggered epidemics in 37 countries last year, versus 22 countries in 2021. It sickened 9 million children and killed 136,00, mostly in poorer countries, the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new report.The number of measles cases also rose by nearly 20 percent after immunization levels dropped to their lowest in 15 years during the pandemic, the agencies said.Advertisement“The increase in measles outbreaks and deaths is staggering, but unfortunately, not unexpected given the declining vaccination rates we’ve seen in the past few years,” said CDC’s John Vertefeuille in a statement.Two doses of the measles vaccine are highly protective against the disease. Children in developing countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and India are at highest risk. WHO and CDC said that immunization rates in poorer countries are about 66 percent, “a rate that shows no recovery at all from the backsliding during the pandemic.”Measles is among the most infectious diseases known and spreads in the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is most common in children under 5. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and a distinctive rash.Most deaths are due to complications like encephalitis, severe dehydration, serious breathing problems, and pneumonia. Complications are most likely in young children and adults over 30.The disease has also surged in some rich countries in recent years. British health authorities warned in July that there was an extremely high risk of outbreaks in London, with some areas of the capital reporting that only 40 percent of children were vaccinated.Immunization rates against measles in the UK have never fully recovered since spurious claims that linked the vaccine to autism were made by discredited British doctor Andrew Wakefield more than two decades ago. No scientific studies have ever confirmed the link, but Wakefield’s research led to millions of parents worldwide abandoning the shot.AdvertisementBoston Globe Today","{

Picture by Liam WormaldManaging herbicide-damaged lentils without rain can be a long and challenging situation, says SARDI senior weed ecology research agronomist Navneet Aggarwal.Speaking at the Mallee Sustainable Farming grain and legume field day, he shared his research findings on weed management for lentils in sandy soils.With funding from the South Australian Grain Industry Trust and the GRDC, Dr Aggarwal and a team of researchers investigated crop safety and weed control of Reflex and Terrain herbicides and their combinations with Group two, five and 12 herbicides on different soil types, textures and pH in 2021 and 2022.There were four trial sites set-up in 2021 at Alford and Bute and four at Wards Hill, Paskeville and Bute in 2022 to assess crop herbicide safety and weed control on imidazoline herbicide tolerant lentils, with each trial sites containing IMI tolerant lentils, sown in late May and early JuneDr Aggarwal said the stunting of plant growth was a clear symptom of herbicide resistance at some of the trial sites.""Stunting caused by Reflex was rate responsive and was generally worse on alkaline sands and alkaline medium textured soils, compared to acidic sands and near-neutral medium textured soils,"" he said.""The stunting symptom was barely present within the first six weeks post-emergence but gradually worsened into late winter and early spring.""The cumulative effect of Reflex ,followed by diuron on stunting symptoms, was more pronounced in alkaline sandy soils in the Yorke Peninsula, as compared to alkaline medium textured silty soil in Tooligie.""Recovery was dependent on the rainfall, he said.""In the 2021 season, the late winter and spring rainfall was well below average, resulting in a lack of recovery from earlier herbicide damage,"" he said.""The 2022 spring rainfall was average to above average, which allowed for good moisture availability and longer recovery time and resulted in better recovery from herbicide damage.""Along with stunting plant growth, Dr Aggarwal said grain yield quality had also been affected by herbicide damage.""Over the two seasons, the grain yield differences caused by the preceding herbicide damage was generally consistent across the two sandy sites,"" he said.""Herbicides, Diuron and Reflex applied alone were more damaging at the alkaline sand sites, which aligns with recorded spring NDVI values.""In 2021, the lentil crop safety varied between the acidic and alkaline sands, with the use of Reflex, diuron, metribuzin and terbuthylazine herbicides, with alkaline sand sites leading to more herbicide damage than acidic sand sites.In 2022 the research trials continued and - due to lentil production expanding across the Eyre Peninsula, in particular in the alkaline light to medium textured soils - the research was extended to better represent the the different soil and weather conditions, compared with YP.The trial results were significantly impacted by rainfall levels, Mr Aggarwal said, with a better recovery from herbicide damage symptoms from Reflex and Terrain in 2022 due to a higher spring rainfall than in 2021.""A total of 219 millimetres and 295mm growing season rainfall was recieved at Wards Hill (alkaline loamy sand) and Paskeville (neutral clay soil) sites, respectively in 2022,"" he said.Following the rainfall in 2022, Wards Hill and Bute sites received 39mm and 53mm rainfall, within the first two weeks of sowing.In 2021 Mr Aggarwal said there were two major rainfalls, with 28mm and 24mm of rainfall in the first and second week after seeding in Bute.During the trials, he also discovered which herbicides would affect the plant establishment process.""Reflex didn't result in any plant establishment issues on any soil type when applied alone at the low and high label rate,"" he said.""Terrain reduced plant establishment at all sites regardless of soil types, except for one alkalkine sand site in 2021. Diuron applied alone didn't impact plant establishment at the alkaline sand sites, compared to the control trial, except at one site and didn't reduce establishment at the acidic sand sites.""A combination of products had a bigger impact on establishment than individual application.Dr Aggarwal said when Reflex was applied with Diuron, the herbicide damage and yield loss was larger at the alkaline sand sites and a combination of Reflex and Diuron was safer at alkaline medium textured soil in Tooligie in 2022, compared with alkaline sand sites, which did not experience yield loss.For broadleaf weed control in lentil crops, he said the group two IMI herbicides would continue to be a valuable tool for broadleaf weed control not effectively controlled with different herbicides.""Rotating with other effective modes of action will reduce resistance selection pressure of this vulnerable herbicide group and sustain its efficacy on important weeds further into the future, considering for some weed species, IMI resistance is already well developed,"" he said.After the trials Dr Aggarwal said the group 14 herbicides could be associated with risks of crop damage and yield loss.He said this emphasised the need for careful planning of weed control on acidic, alkaline and sandy soils to get satisfactory weed control and adequate crop safety.ShareFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmailCopyAdvertisementAdLocal NewsParamedics waiting for pay offer call premier to table44m agoFree app may be a life saver for cardiac arrest victims1hr agoWHO asks China for details on respiratory outbreak2hrs agoNation-first living lab ready to tackle deadly cancerLocal NewsParamedics waiting for pay offer call premier to table44m agoFree app may be a life saver for cardiac arrest victims1hr agoWHO asks China for details on respiratory outbreak2hrs agoNation-first living lab ready to tackle deadly cancerElectronic medical record glitch hits hospitalsLocal NewsParamedics waiting for pay offer call premier to table44m agoFree app may be a life saver for cardiac arrest victims1hr agoWHO asks China for details on respiratory outbreak2hrs agoNation-first living lab ready to tackle deadly cancerElectronic medical record glitch hits hospitalsMouth-painting artist taking talent to a whole new levelNo commentsLocal NewsParamedics waiting for pay offer call premier to table44m agoFree app may be a life saver for cardiac arrest victims1hr agoWHO asks China for details on respiratory outbreak2hrs agoNation-first living lab ready to tackle deadly cancerElectronic medical record glitch hits hospitalsMouth-painting artist taking talent to a whole new levelNo commentsGet the latest SA news in your inboxSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.Email addressNotify meWe care about the protection of your data.

The number of measles cases also rose by nearly 20% after immunization levels dropped to their lowest in 15 years during the pandemic, the agencies said. “The increase in measles outbreaks and deaths is staggering, but unfortunately, not unexpected given the declining vaccination rates we’ve seen in the past few years,” said CDC's John Vertefeuille, said in a statement. Two doses of the measles vaccine are highly protective against the disease. Children in developing countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America and India are at highest risk. WHO and CDC said that immunization rates in poorer countries are about 66%, “a rate that shows no recovery at all from the backsliding during the pandemic.” Measles is among the most infectious diseases known and spreads in the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is most common in children under 5. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and a distinctive rash. Most deaths are due to complications like encephalitis, severe dehydration, serious breathing problems and pneumonia. Complications are most likely in young children and adults over 30. The disease has also surged in some rich countries in recent years. British health authorities warned in July that there was an extremely high risk of outbreaks in London, with some areas of the capital reporting that only 40% of children were vaccinated. Immunization rates against measles in the U.K. have never fully recovered since spurious claims that linked the vaccine to autism were made by discredited British doctor Andrew Wakefield more than two decades ago. No scientific studies have ever confirmed the link, but Wakefield's research led to millions of parents worldwide abandoning the shot.    ""Exciting news!

There was a lot of dumping by the Chinese, but globally now we are seeing a recovery happening. So the theme for the first quarter could be chemicals and within that speciality chemicals could outperform that is worth a look, says Ajay Bagga""ETMarkets.comThere is a strong possibility that you get a kind of a Santa Claus rally, even in the Indian markets and then it tapers off by Feb-end as the elections are announced, says Ajay Bagga, Market Expert. Edited excerpts. How do you see India placed at this point in time as there are a couple of triggers ahead for us, especially the election? With respect to the global setup, China specifically, given the mysterious pneumonia outbreak, do you believe that it could be a concern for India as well? We are a neighbouring country. What is the growth outlook for China that you are holding at this point?China can slow down further from this year. We are expecting about 3.8%-3.9% GDP growth next year for China. The property sector issue is still huge. Yesterday, the government came out with a very delayed plan. They are again depending on the banks to shore up the property sector which would not work out. The banks have their own issues and for banks to do unsecured lending to a troubled property sector is really pushing all walls of credibility. Of course, these are state-owned banks. Once the orders come in, some amount of cosmetic lending will happen. But the markets became sceptical within a day. So Friday, we saw some selling in the Chinese property sector as well, and the indices were also soft. Overall, will India benefit? Yes, we have seen some flows. But what happens is the strong dollar, the Fed peak, normally we see that emerging market outflows, turn into inflows. So India should be a beneficiary. We have not seen that in the last three months; we have lost $4 billion in terms of FII outflows. We see that continuing through May because of the national elections. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Digital OfficerVisitIIM KozhikodeIIMK Chief Product Officer ProgrammeVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Technology OfficerVisitThe good news is that the DIIs and the retail Indian investors are picking up that slack very strongly with the SIP numbers in mutual funds and the institutional flows from EPFO and insurance. So that would not be a source of worry for the Indian index. But we have underperformed global markets for the last three months, especially in November, where the MSCI global indices have done very well, India has been somewhat of a laggard to that. So there will be a catch-up. Now, will that play out over the next three months leading into February? I think that there is a strong possibility that you get a kind of a Santa Claus rally, even in the Indian markets and then it tapers off by Feb-end as the elections are announced. March-April will be the elections. May will be the formation of the new government. A lot of volatility is expected around that. So once the state elections are announced a week from now, I think the Indian markets will really take off again and breach some good levels. And then around February, we could see a taper coming in once more.We have the OPEC meet next week and it has been delayed and this is coming at a time when the oil prices are sinking. What do you think about the oil prices going forward? Is there room for more correction?I do not think so. Prince Abdulaziz, the Saudi foreign minister, last week had warned about the shorting of the oil prices. Even now, it is at a record level, the short interest in the Brent Futures market. What caused the further fall in the oil prices over the last three days was the postponement of the OPEC Plus meeting because the African producers are not agreeing to the Saudi proposal for holding on to production cuts. They want their new capacity to be ratified as the UAE has got ratification for its new capacity. There is excess supply because of the slowdown in Europe. We are seeing some amount of excess supply and next year, first quarter, we are expecting some more surplus. So oil prices should stay range bound. The option with the Saudis to reduce production always stays but they are already suffering from reducing nearly one billion barrels per day, the voluntary cut that they have taken. Their budget is in deficit and just today they have borrowed about $11 billion in a syndicated loan from various banks to take care of this fiscal deficit. So there is pressure on the Saudi fiscal, but they are very clear that they want to reduce the production. The Russians will vote with the Saudis but the Africans are not playing ball. So I would say November 30th, you will probably see status quo which has got discounted and post that you could see a marginal bid up in the oil price. But I do not see a sharp fall that is not happening. There is no economic slowdown which will lead to a sharp fall. Rather, it is a mildly surplus market and it will stay so for the next three months.Which sectors look interesting to you at this point in time because we have seen a couple of underperformers performing like insurance was a sector that garnered the investor's interest. Other than that, pharma, IT, metals have been showing decent moves. So any sector that is on your radar right now?Speciality chemicals are coming back. There was a lot of dumping by the Chinese, but globally now we are seeing a recovery happening. So the theme for the first quarter could be chemicals and within that speciality chemicals could outperform which is worth a look. Sugar prices are going up globally. I think we will get some interest in the sugar sector. The third could be cement. The government has spent 60% of its infrastructure budget already and more will go through. There is talk that in this winter session, the supplemental grants will ask for more infrastructure spending and on the back of that, cement could go up. And then there is defence. The big order expectations on both fighter jets as well as the aircraft carrier, I think has again injected fresh interest in the manufacturing companies for that, most of which are in the public sector domain. I think defence is also looking good.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easyExperience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!Saturday, 25 Nov, 2023Read Complete ePaper »Digital ViewPrint ViewWealth EditionMega IPO Show Ends on a High, All Eyes on Listing DayOne of the busiest weeks for India’s initial public offer (IPO) market ended on a euphoric note with investors pouring an unprecedented ₹2.6 lakh crore into five issues that aimed to collect ₹7,380 crore.‘Social Media Cos have Seven Days to Tweak Terms of Use’The government has advised social media and internet intermediaries to “align” the terms of service on their platforms within the next seven days to alert users about the consequences of creating, uploading and sharing prohibited information including deepfake content or child sexual abuse material (CSAM), minister of state for electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said Friday.As Local Exotic Flowers Bloom, Imports Wilt Wedding planner Mukta Kapoor recently had a client request an arrangement of locally grown nargis flowers (daffodils).

Photo: Naomi JellicoeLifestyleDon't miss out on the headlines from Lifestyle. Followed categories will be added to My News.A leading infectious diseases paediatrician is warning of a whooping cough outbreak as national data points to a surge of cases this summer.The caution comes as an Adelaide grandmother pleads for people to take heed and check their vaccination status, after losing her only grandson to the illness when he was just four weeks old. Known as the “100-day cough” or pertussis, it is a highly contagious bacterial infection that attacks the airways, causing uncontrollable coughing that can result in a “whoop”-like sound and difficulty breathing. Professor Robert Booy said rates of the disease, which increases in prominence as the weather heats up and typically peaks every four years, had tripled this year, compared to last. National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System statistics show there have been 1541 confirmed cases of whooping cough to date in 2023, compared to 481 in 2022.“Whooping cough is very severe in newborns where in the first few weeks and months of life it can lead to pneumonia, to hospitalisation and even death,” the University of Sydney child health expert said.Baby Riley Hughes died at four weeks from whooping cough with his death becoming the catalyst for bringing the maternal vaccination for whooping cough to Australia. Photo: Naomi Jellicoe“Whooping cough follows a fairly predictable pattern … we’ve seen years when whooping cough infections in Australia have neared 40,000. “(Due to social distancing during Covid) it has been eight years since our last peak, so we are due one and we are observing that now, with numbers going up rapidly.”A newborn’s immunity is boosted when its mum is vaccinated during pregnancy with babies given the first of a five-dose schedule at two months.It is recommended adults be vaccinated every “10 to 15” years with SA Health’s Notifiable Disease Report noting “cases of whooping cough have been recognised in adults and adolescents due to waning immunity”.The report also states “whooping cough is highly infectious, spreading across 70 to 100 per cent of susceptible household contacts and 50 to 80 per cent of susceptible school contacts”.Elizabeth Park schoolteacher Julie Hughes met her only grandson, Riley, for the first time in 2015 – when he was in intensive care at a Perth hospital, suffering from whooping cough. He died several hours later.“I got a call in the middle of the night to say he’d taken a turn for the worse and flew out on the next flight,” the now 66-year-old said. “It was the most devastating and traumatic thing, I have never seen anything so horrific in my whole life.”Breaking down in tears she recalls how Riley’s parents – her son Greg and his wife Catherine – took their second child to hospital when he became “snuffly” and didn’t want to feed.“He started to deteriorate … he was christened and everyone got to hold him before he died,” she said. “You don’t ever get over it … I don’t have a grandson anymore.”Little Riley’s death was the catalyst for bringing the maternal vaccination for whooping cough to Australia with his parents teaming up with passionate immunisation advocates to establish a not-for-profit charity, The Immunisation Foundation of Australia.Join the conversationAdd your comment to this storyTo join the conversation, please","{

20231126180000-531,2023-11-26,35.0,105.0,"In the backdrop of rising instances of respiratory illnesses among children in parts of China, India’s Health Ministry will carry out a review of the available public health infrastructure and its readiness across different states and Union Territories (UTs). The state governments have been asked to send nasal and throat swabs for testing respiratory pathogens. According to senior Union Health Ministry officials, the ongoing season (winter) is generally seen as one which can cause “an increase in respiratory illness cases in India”. In a letter to the states and UTs, the Union Health Secretary to has sought an “immediate review of public health and hospital preparedness measures”.Review would include availability of hospital beds, drugs and vaccines for influenza, medical oxygen, antibiotics, personal protective equipment, testing kits and reagents, functionality of oxygen plants and ventilators, infection control practices in health facilities, at a senior level.Also Read: WHO asks China for details on rising respiratory illnessesChina has been facing a surge in respiratory infections such as influenza and clusters of pneumonia among children, with hospitals reporting being “overwhelmed.” The “mystery illness” reportedly has sparked fears of another outbreak causing alarm across many nations. “The Government is closely monitoring the situation (in China and India) and indicated that there is no need for any alarm,” the Health Ministry said in a statement. ”So far there is no concerning surge in respiratory illness cases here in India. Some seasonal incidents are being noticed, which is quite usual during this time of the year,” the official said. The States have ben advised to implement ‘Operational Guidelines for Revised Surveillance Strategy in the context of COVID-19’, shared earlier this year: The guidelines include integrated surveillance of respiratory pathogens “presenting as cases of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI).” “State governments  have also been asked to ensure that the trends of ILI/SARI should be closely monitored by the district and state surveillance units of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), particularly of children and adolescents,” a senior Health Ministry official told businessline. As per protocol, data of ILI/SARI is required to be uploaded on IDSP- IHIP portal particularly from the public health institutions including medical college hospitals. States have also asked to send nasal and throat swab samples of patients with SARI, particularly of children and adolescents, to Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDL’s) located in the respective states for testing for respiratory pathogens Also Read: AI in healthcare holds promise, but needs regulation: WHO  “The cumulative effect of implementation of these precautionary and proactive collaborative measures is expected to counter any potential situation and ensure the safety and well-being of the citizens,” the Ministry said in a statement. Situation in China Information shared by World Health Organisation (WHO), a Union Health Ministry official said, has indicated an increase in respiratory illness in northern parts of China. This is predominantly attributed to usual causes like Influenza, Mycoplasma pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 etc.As per WHO, the release of Covid-19 restrictions coinciding with the onset of winter season in addition to cyclical trend of respiratory illnesses such as Mycoplasma pneumonia have led to this surge. While WHO has sought additional information from Chinese authorities, it is assessed that there is no cause of alarm “at the moment”. In an earlier statement , WHO had said data shared by China stated that “no unusual or novel pathogens have been detected”.  The international health organisation had said, the surge was likely linked to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions as China experiences its first full winter season since declaring an end to the pandemic in December.","{

They just have a high temperature (fever) and many develop pulmonary nodules.""Analysing the news report, ProMed said in its editor's note regarding the mysterious respiratory disease: ""This report suggests a widespread outbreak of an undiagnosed respiratory illness.""It is not at all clear when this outbreak started as it would be unusual for so many children to be affected so quickly. The report does not say that any adults were affected suggesting some exposure at the schools.""At the same time, the same area has also seen a surge in influenza-like illnesses since mid-October when comparing the numbers to the same period in the past three years, the WHO said.It is however unclear whether the clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia were associated with an overall increase in respiratory infections or if these are two separate events.While concerning, these reported respiratory diseases could be linked to the fact China has lifted its tight COVID-19 restrictions, including testing and isolation rules, only last December.Other nations that implemented social distances to quash the number of coronavirus infections - including the UK - saw similar surges in respiratory diseases after they eventually relaxed their social distancing rules.China has seen cases of mycoplasma pneumoniae, also known as ""walking pneumonia"", rising as it enters its first winter without lockdown measures.Among the symptoms appearing with walking pneumonia, which normally affects young children, are sore throat, fatigue, and a lingering cough. Most severe cases can see the disease deteriorate into pneumonia.Speaking about the many cases of mycoplasma pneumoniae, Zhou Huixia, director of the children's medical centre at the Seventh Medical Center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital, told China Daily: ""It is the first wave of mycoplasma pneumoniae infections since most COVID-19 containment measures were lifted at the beginning of this year.""The wave has appeared particularly ferocious since the National Day holiday in early October. Compared to previous years, we found more patients with mixed infections, drug resistance and lobar pneumonia.""The ""intense"" wave of infections is expected to peak this month and may coincide with an uptick in other infectious respiratory diseases suppressed during lockdown, she also said.Hospitals in northern China are reportedly overwhelmed with sick children (Image: GETTY)What is the WHO doing?The WHO has issued an official request to China for additional information regarding trends in the circulation of known pathogens as well as how the rise of cases has been burdening the healthcare system.Moreover, it has required laboratory results from the reported outbreaks among youngsters.This has been described as a ""routine"" check by the WHO.While it waits to get more detailed information, the health organisation has urged Chinese communities affected by the illness to take preventative measures, similar to those embraced during the coronavirus pandemic.Among them are vaccination, mask-wearing, maintaining distance from sick people, regular hand-washing and remaining at home when ill.What has China said?Chinese authorities first acknowledged the rise of the influenza-like illnesses in mid-October.During a press conference on November 13, they spoke again of a spike in respiratory diseases in the country, which they have attributed to a cold snap and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.Wang Quanyi, deputy director and chief epidemiological expert at the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state media on November 22 that Beijing has ""entered a high incidence season of respiratory infectious diseases"" after temperatures plummeted. The city ""is currently showing a trend of multiple pathogens coexisting"", he added.Chinese experts have acknowledged it has been difficult to manage the rise in paediatric respiratory diseases this year.Last month director of the outpatient department of Beijing Children’s Hospital Li Yuchuan told China Voice: ""It has been running at a relatively high level.""The first peak occurred from mid-to-late February to late March, when influenza was the main cause; the second peak occurred in May, when there were a variety of pathogens, such as RSV; the third peak appeared in September.""

Chinese officials attribute the increase to mycoplasma pneumoniae, RSV, adenovirus, and influenza, ruling out novel pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, causing mild infections similar to colds, worries parents due to potential pneumonia development. Severe cases require antibiotics, but China's high antibiotic resistance poses concern. The outbreak's cause remains unclear, but it occurred earlier than normal and other countries experienced similar surges after pandemic restrictions.  Children and their parents wait at an outpatient area at a children hospital in Beijing.A man carries a child as they leave a children's hospital in Beijing. Children and their parents wait at an outpatient area at a children hospital in Beijing.A man carries a child as they leave a children's hospital in Beijing. Children and their parents wait at an outpatient area at a children hospital in Beijing.12 China’s health-care system is once again in the spotlight as a wave of pneumonia cases sweeps through the country, hitting kids particularly hard. The sudden increase in sick children, and a report suggesting widespread clusters of undiagnosed respiratory illnesses, prompted the World Health Organization to ask for more details in order to allay concerns that a novel pathogen — something like Covid-19— was the source of the outbreaks.So far, Chinese officials say, it’s simply a laundry list of known germs that’s causing the problem.1. What do health experts say?Doctors have been warning for weeks that a common bacterial infection would likely cause a spike in “walking pneumonia” cases. In response to the WHO’s request for more data, Chinese health authorities said the uptick in outpatient visits and hospitalizations has been due to the spread of mycoplasma pneumoniae, RSV, adenovirus and influenza. Importantly, they say they haven’t detected any new pathogens. In turn, the WHO said that while the level of illness is unusually high for this time of year, it’s not unusual for winter to bring respiratory diseases. The group advised people to take basic precautions to reduce their risk — wear masks, stay home when sick, wash their hands regularly — and said there’s no need for any travel restrictions based on the current situation.A man carries a child outside a children's hospital in Beijing.2. What is mycoplasma pneumoniae?Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a bacteria that typically causes a mild infection, with symptoms that are similar to a common cold. It rarely requires hospitalization but sometimes a cough could for last for weeks and younger children with a nascent immune system are at greater risk of developing pneumonia. That’s what’s worrying parents. Local media have reported that some of China’s top pediatric medical centers have been overwhelmed with sick kids, with some families needing to wait seven hours to see a doctor. Chinese social media has also been awash with photos of crowded waiting rooms and hallways, and children hooked up to intravenous drips.Unlike Covid, mycoplasma is a known germ causing periodic outbreaks.3. What do I do if I catch it?Most people will recover from an infection on their own or with over-the-counter medications to help alleviate symptoms. But more severe illness will typically require a course of antibiotics. That’s especially concerning since China has the world’s highest incidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae that’s resistant to a class of antibiotic called macrolides. Up to 60% to 70% of adult cases and up to 80% of cases in kids don’t respond to Zithromax and similar drugs, Yin Yudong, an infectious diseases doctor at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, the nation’s top respiratory disease center, told Beijing News earlier this month.4. Why is it hitting China so hard?It’s unclear why China appears to be the only country facing a major mycoplasma outbreak, while the US and much of Europe have contended with flu and RSV. One study showed mycoplasma pneumoniae was subdued in China for almost two years by Covid countermeasures that have since been lifted. While Chinese health authorities have said the uptick in cases comes earlier than normal, they’ve also pointed out that other countries have experienced similar surges in respiratory disease after emerging from pandemic restrictions. 5. Will it spread overseas?For those outside China, the reports of respiratory-illness outbreaks have brought back memories of the early days of the Covid pandemic, which first emerged as mysterious pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan in 2019 and whose origin has never been definitely pinned down. But unlike Covid, mycoplasma is a well-known and common germ that tends to cause fresh outbreaks every few years. And other viruses are circulating too, particularly RSV, meaning it’s likely that this winter will see countries across the world face a variety of pathogens.

20231126050000-247,2023-11-26,-1.0,-1.0,"Pharma thinks we need a “vaccine” for every illness, even if it shows up in most people as a mild cold. This latest one has been granted fast-track designation, meaning it will skip the usual scrutiny, just like the covid injections did. Get ready for the fear-mongering so people will roll up their sleeves again.Moderna just moved one step closer to bringing mRNA-1345, an RSV injection, to market.  The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted the experimental injection fast-track designation in August 2021.  Moderna’s mRNA RSV injection has now been given Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which allows for faster development and an expedited review period.RSV is usually not serious; most people experience only mild, cold-like symptoms and recover on their own in a week or two.Moderna plans to file for FDA approval of mRNA-1345 in the first half of 2023.  Along with Moderna’s mRNA RSV injection, Pfizer and GSK have also developed RSV vaccines that are awaiting regulatory approval.By Dr. Joseph MercolaGet ready. A new mRNA injection is barrelling down the runway and may be available as soon as fall 2023. This time, it’s not to target SARS-CoV-2 but, rather, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogen that typically causes mild cold-like symptoms.Pfizer and Moderna are racing to bring their RSV injections to market, and Moderna just moved one step closer with its mRNA-1345. The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted the experimental injection fast-track designation in August 2021. Now, Moderna’s mRNA RSV injection has been given Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which allows for faster development and an expedited review period.1WEF Warns of RSV ‘Tripledemic’You may have seen RSV making headlines more often than usual this winter – in lockstep with the mRNA injections soon to be released to save us all from it. In November 2022, the World Economic Forum (“WEF”) warned RSV could cause a “tripledemic” along with covid-19 and flu.2It reported case numbers of RSV rising in the US and Canada because children weren’t exposed to this and other common infections during covid-19 lockdowns.3 The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention also warned:4CDC surveillance has shown an increase in RSV detections and RSV-associated emergency department visits and hospitalisations in multiple US regions, with some regions nearing seasonal peak levels. Clinicians and public health professionals should be aware of increases in respiratory viruses, including RSV.Still, RSV is usually not serious; most people recover on their own in a week or two. While it can lead to severe illness, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in infants younger than 1 year and older adults, almost all children have had an RSV infection by their second birthday5 – and most recover from it just fine.We saw from Operation Warp Speed how pharmaceutical companies and governments have bragged about the speed with which they can approve new injections, however. And the RSV injection is no different. At this point, the obligatory RSV propaganda seems perfectly timed to ramp up with the coming release of a new RSV injection.Moderna’s mRNA RSV Injection Is on the WayThe FDA granted Moderna’s mRNA-1345 Breakthrough Therapy Designation based on a Phase 3 trial involving 37,000 adults aged 60 years and older.6 The mRNA RSV injection had a reported efficacy of 83.7% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease. Moderna plans to file for FDA approval of mRNA-1345 in the first half of 2023.7The injection initially would be intended for adults aged 60 and over, but Moderna is also testing its mRNA RSV injection in children via an ongoing Phase 1 trial.8 “With this designation, we look forward to productive conversations with the FDA in the hopes of bringing our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults to the market safely and quickly,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said.9Moderna’s RSV injection uses the same lipid nanoparticle as its covid-19 injection. The primary difference between the two injections is the coding of the mRNA. In the RSV injection, the mRNA encodes for a prefusion F glycoprotein. Prefusion F protein is a protein that mediates the RSV virus’ entry into your cells and is known to elicit a neutralising antibody response.10Under normal circumstances, it’s hard to imagine an RSV vaccine built on a novel mRNA platform getting fast-tracked, but we’re no longer in normal times. The rollout of mRNA covid-19 injections has, as predicted, paved the way for any number of new mRNA-based injections going straight to human trials. RSV is just the beginning.Moderna Has 48 mRNA Injection Programs UnderwayAt WEF’s Davos Agenda 2022, at a session titled “covid-19: What’s Next?”11 Bancel was open about Moderna’s plans to combine multiple “vaccines,” such as a covid-19 dose, a flu dose and an RSV dose, into one injection – coming in 2023 – to avoid “compliance issues.” He said:12The other piece we’re working on is for 2023, is how do we make it possible from a societal standpoint that people want to be vaccinated?And we’re going to do this by preparing combinations, we’re working on the flu vaccine, we’re working on an RSV vaccine, and our goal is to be able to have a single annual booster, so that we don’t have compliance issues, where people don’t want to get two to three shots a winter, but they get one dose, where they get a booster for corona, and a booster for flu and RSV, to make sure that people get their vaccine.When asked how soon this would occur, he continued:13,14So the RSV program is now in Phase 3, the flu program is in Phase 2 and soon in Phase 3, I hope as soon as second quarter of this year. So the best-case scenario would be the fall of 2023, as a best case scenario …At the 2023 WEF meeting in Davos, Bancel again spoke about mRNA injections, this time stating he’d “like to have mRNA capacity on every continent.”15 It seems they’re well on their way.As of January 2023, Moderna has 48 programs in development, including “36 programs in clinical trials encompassing investigational mRNA infectious disease vaccine candidates and mRNA therapeutic candidates spanning seven different modalities.”16 In a news release, Bancel reported:17Applying our experience and using our mRNA platform, we are developing vaccine candidates that we believe could one day help prevent hospitalisations and deaths from some of the most prevalent respiratory viruses.We are also progressing several respiratory vaccine candidates, including combination vaccines against multiple respiratory viruses, and are committed to building our respiratory franchise.By pursuing combination products to protect against a range of diseases, we believe that we can potentially help decrease morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease, lower healthcare costs and increase health security globally.Moderna Made mRNA ‘Breakthrough’ Right Before PandemicThe Pentagon’s secretive Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) has been working for years to develop an antibody to any virus within 60 days of collecting blood from a survivor.18Its Pandemic Prevention Platform program, known as P3, “aims specifically to develop a scalable, adaptable, rapid response platform capable of producing relevant numbers of doses against any known or previously unknown infectious threat within 60 days of identification of such a threat in order to keep the outbreak from escalating and decrease disruptions to the military and homeland.”19DARPA also launched ADEPT:PROTECT (Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics: Prophylactic Options to Environmental and Contagious Threats) to develop technologies – like mRNA – that can be rapidly deployed against emerging infectious diseases and biological weapons.20It was September 2019 when Moderna announced it had developed mRNA-1944 – the first systemic mRNA therapeutic to show production of a secreted protein in humans – courtesy of financial support from DARPA’s ADEPT:PROTECT program.21 Months later, the covid-19 pandemic would result in the development of the first experimental mRNA gene therapy, which has been distributed among the masses. The Highwire reported:22With uncanny foresight, Moderna’s expeditious mRNA endeavour… had immediate manufacturing support from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to ensure the pandemic’s gene-editing jabs traversed the globe. Significantly, CEPI was founded in 2017 by the WEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the governments of Norway and India.Aligned with the same goals as DARPA, CEPI is a global syndicate of public-private organisations whose mission is to highlight pandemic threats, continuously prepare for the next “Disease X,” and advance vaccines.Presently, over 13 billion doses of covid-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide. With vaccine manufacturers protected from liability, evidence increasingly indicates that mRNA injections are not just failing but, more significantly, are causing many serious adverse events, including myocarditis, increased risk of cancer and stroke, and death.Will mRNA RSV Injections Trigger a Public Health Disaster?Past attempts to develop RSV vaccines have ended in tragedy, particularly in the 1960s. In a trial on infants, two babies died after first appearing to tolerate the injection. The problem occurred during the following cold and flu season when 80% of those vaccinated caught RSV and had to be hospitalised. Only 5% of those who received the placebo injection were hospitalised for RSV.23The issue is antibody-dependent enhancement (“ADE”), a problem that’s also occurred in the development of coronavirus injections. In 2020, Timothy Cardozo of NYU Langone Health and Ronald Veazey with the Tulane University School of Medicine set out to determine if enough research existed to require clinicians to disclose the specific risk that covid-19 shots could worsen disease if the recipient is exposed to circulating virus – similar to what occurred in the RSV trial.They reviewed preclinical and clinical evidence, which revealed that ADE is a significant concern, noting:24Covid‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern:… that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen covid‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE).They concluded that to meet medical ethics standards of informed consent, people who receive covid-19 injections should be clearly warned of the “specific and significant covid-19 risk of ADE.”25 This didn’t happen, and it likely won’t for RSV injections, either.More RSV Injections in the PipelineAlong with Moderna’s mRNA RSV injections, Pfizer and GSK have also developed RSV “vaccines” that are awaiting regulatory approval. Pfizer is even targeting its RSV injection to pregnant women, claiming it can help prevent RSV in newborns. While Moderna is also planning trials in pregnant women, GSK stopped its pregnancy trial in 2022 due to safety concerns.26But no matter which pharmaceutical company ends up being the first to bring it to market, the RSV “vaccine” is clearly on the way. It could potentially be available by fall 2023, and the way RSV was hyped over the winter, it likely won’t be long before this shot moves beyond the older people target and expands to infants and children, becoming another requirement on the official vaccine schedule.But considering the multitude of problems associated with the mRNA covid-19 injections, I’m not optimistic about the development of a fast-tracked mRNA injection against RSV. The risks of these experimental, fast-tracked injections are serious, while, in most cases, RSV is not. Sources and References1, 9 Investor’s Business Daily January 30, 20232, 3 World Economic Forum November 16, 20224 U.S. CDC, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection (RSV)5 U.S. CDC, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection (RSV), Symptoms and Care6, 8, 16, 17 Moderna January 17, 20237 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News January 20, 202310 Nature Communications May 8, 2019; 10: 210511 World Economic Forum, covid-19: What’s Next?

Needle, a pathologist at the New Hampshire Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and clinical associate professor at the University of New Hampshire, and a team of researchers have been unable to identify it as any known canine respiratory disease.“This early metagenomic work did not reveal any RNA or DNA virus of concern, and no typical fungal or bacterial respiratory pathogens were identified,” the researchers wrote.Since the middle of August, the American Veterinary Medical Association said vets in Oregon have reported over 200 cases.The mysterious illness was described as an “atypical canine infectious respiratory disease,” by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and symptoms include coughing, sneezing, eye or nose discharge and lethargy.Melissa Justice, a veterinarian at the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, told CNN most of the cases reported to her agency appear to be similar to kennel cough, but it doesn’t respond to normal medication and the cough lasts longer than the normal seven to 10 days.“Affected dogs may begin to show signs of lethargy, fever, decreased appetite, productive cough, nasal and / or ocular discharge, respiratory distress, or pneumonia,” Justice said.The federal government is also getting involved. A spokesperson for the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service told CNN it is working with local agencies and diagnostic laboratories to identify the disease.Where have cases been reported?Pennsylvania may be the latest state to have dogs possibly coming down with the mystery illness.John Donges of the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania told CNN, “We have only just received our first cases over the weekend.”In Colorado, veterinarians are seeing a lot of cases in high-volume areas such as boarding facilities, doggie day cares and dog parks.“Clinical findings and tests completed to date suggest that most dogs with the unusual syndrome have a virus that primarily targets the respiratory system, leading to secondary bacterial infection and pneumonia in affected dogs,” said an article published by the Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.“We have seen around 35 cases at my hospital alone, four of which have either passed away or been euthanized due to severity of the pneumonia. We are unsure at this time if this is viral or bacterial in origin,” Lindsey L. Ganzer, the CEO of North Springs Veterinary Referral Center in Colorado Springs, told CNN.In Massachusetts, the Department of Agricultural Resources said it is working with neighboring states “to better understand the factors at play” and kennel operators should be requiring vaccination to prevent future outbreaks.Veterinarians in California have seen the disease, too, with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health’s Veterinary Public Health Program receiving 10 case reports from veterinarians since November 16.In Washington, the state’s Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory has also reported an increase in sick dogs.“There has been an uptick in the numbers of dogs with respiratory disease, (coughing, lethargy, fever) and the signs have been persisting longer than a few days,” Kevin Snekvik, the lab’s executive director and a professor at the Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine, told CNN.The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management said because a common cause of the illness reported in other states hasn’t been determined, it is hard to say if the disease has reached the state, but acknowledged the department “is aware of a small number of dogs in the state that died or were euthanized after experiencing similar signs. Unfortunately, these dogs weren’t subjected to a postmortem examination, so the cause of their illness was not determined.”Idaho State Veterinarian Scott Leibsle also said there was no way to be sure, but “since the recent media reports have come about, several vets in Idaho have reached out to ISDA (Idaho State Department of Agriculture) with reports that they had seen multiple cases of an aggressive respiratory disease that is minimally or non-responsive to treatment, over the course of the summer (June/July/Aug).” But those veterinarians said more recent cases of respiratory disease in dogs seem to be more routine, according to Leibsle.Vermont State Veterinarian Kristin Haas said New England has been seeing cases of this since at least early summer 2022. Some cases have been fatal, while others have not gone beyond the equivalent of a “common cold” type illness, Haas said.The University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine recently wrote that the lack of a centralized reporting system for canine diseases means it’s not even possible to confirm a spike in a known disease like kennel cough or if there is a new emerging pathogen.“At this time, we recommend being especially vigilant to identify and segregate dogs with respiratory signs,” the college said.What can dog owners do?Dog owners can help keep their pets healthy by making sure they’re up-to-date on all vaccines, such as those for canine influenza, Bordetella and parainfluenza, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association said.Other tips include:• Reducing contact with large numbers of unknown dogs. Just like with other respiratory pathogens, the more contacts your dog has, the greater the risk of encountering a dog that’s infectious.• Reducing contact with sick dogs. This can be harder to determine but if a dog looks sick (coughing, runny nose, runny eyes), keep your dog away from it.• Keep sick dogs at home and seek veterinary care.• Avoid communal water bowls shared by multiple dogs.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com View comments Recommended StoriesYahoo LifeWhat 5 infectious disease experts think about China's surge in respiratory illnessesIs China's ""mysterious"" wave of childhood pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses cause for concern?

Concerns mount as the WHO seeks clarity on the situation. Mycoplasma pneumonia resurfaces, posing viral-like transmission and severe respiratory complications. Vigilance against winter risks, symptom recognition, immunity-building, and antibiotic treatment strategies are vital. Vulnerable groups face heightened susceptibility, emphasizing the importance of early medical intervention for improved recovery chances.IANSThe recent outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia in China since mid-October has raised concerns globally, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, this outbreak has disproportionately affected children, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to take notice. (Image: IANS)China is grappling with a puzzling health crisis as face masks and social distancing rules make a comeback, marking nearly four years since the initial onset of the global pandemic. An enigmatic outbreak has caused a surge in hospitalizations, particularly among children, with cases presenting a severe respiratory illness labeled as ""white lung syndrome.""As Beijing and Liaoning witness a surge in afflicted youngsters, concerns heighten over this newly emergent health threat, marking the first winter post the lifting of Covid restrictions in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) seeks clarifications from Chinese authorities regarding the nature and scope of this concerning situation.The recent outbreak has raised fears among families, with patients enduring prolonged waits in urgent care facilities. Despite the escalating concern, Chinese officials have downplayed the severity, attributing it to typical winter ailments rather than acknowledging a novel virus.According to Ministry spokesperson Mi Feng, efforts are underway to bolster healthcare provisions by expanding clinic accessibility, extending service hours, and augmenting medicine supplies. Urging local authorities to take proactive measures, Feng emphasized the imperative need for fever clinics catering to vulnerable demographics like the elderly and children, advocating for increased vaccination coverage. Additionally, the recommendation to wear masks and maintain social distancing remains pivotal.In response to the outbreak, directives have been issued to safeguard densely populated areas such as schools and nursing homes, aiming to curtail the spread of the illness. Reports from The Sun indicate a staggering daily admission of approximately 7,000 patients at a children's hospital in Beijing.What's causing it and what we need to know to battle itMycoplasma pneumonia, though not a recent bacterium, has surfaced prominently within Chinese communities amidst this outbreak. Distinct from conventional bacteria, its viral-like behavior facilitates swift person-to-person transmission, infiltrating both lung sides and instigating severe coughing and breathing complications. The bacterium's resurgence, particularly among vulnerable groups, raises questions regarding potential mutations or alterations in its behavior following the cessation of stringent Covid containment measures.For years, medical practitioners have treated this bacterial infection using antibiotics within the PCR guidelines. In China, it has circulated alongside the HN92 virus, exhibiting a unique interaction within the ecosystem.Understanding Spread and SymptomsWhile not as rapidly infectious as a virus, mycoplasma pneumonia swiftly targets the throat, nasal cavities, and descends to the lungs, culminating in pneumonia. Vigilance against exposure to individuals exhibiting persistent coughing or sneezing in confined spaces is crucial. Recognizable symptoms encompass red blood cell breakdown, skin rash, joint pain, and a higher risk of contraction during winter. Children commonly manifest symptoms like nasal congestion, sore throat, watery eyes, wheezing, vomiting, and diarrhea.Prevention Measures and RisksStrengthening immunity through balanced diets, exercise, ample rest, and avoiding crowded spaces remains pivotal. The adoption of masks in social settings acts as a shield against diverse respiratory illnesses. Emphasizing proper hygiene practices, including frequent hand washing after contact with infected individuals, is recommended.The infection poses a risk to all age groups, particularly children, the elderly, or individuals with compromised respiratory systems. Prompt medical consultation is advised upon experiencing symptoms such as cough, fever, or breathing difficulties. Early diagnosis significantly enhances recovery prospects, while those with pre-existing respiratory issues face a higher susceptibility to severe infections.Efficacy of Antibiotics and Medical InterventionSeveral antibiotics, including Azithromycin for children and Doxycycline or Moxifloxacin for adults, exhibit efficacy against the infection. However, seeking medical advice before medication is crucial. Medical practitioners rely on stethoscope examinations to detect abnormal breathing patterns, often supplemented by chest X-rays or CT scans for a comprehensive diagnosis.Disclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.

20231202020000-71,2023-12-02,31.5,34.75,"Israel’s war with Hamas resumes with airstrikes in Gaza after a weeklong truce endsKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel’s war with Hamas erupted again Friday, as airstrikes hit houses and buildings in the Gaza Strip minutes after a weeklong truce expired. Health authorities in the besieged territory reported dozens of Palestinians killed and Israel dropped leaflets over Gaza City and southern parts of the enclave, urging civilians to flee to avoid the fighting.Militants in Gaza resumed firing rockets into Israel, and fighting broke out between Israel and Hezbollah militants operating along its northern border with Lebanon.The resumption of the war threatens to compound the suffering in Gaza. Some 2 million people -- almost its entire population -- are crammed into the territory's south, where Israel urged people to relocate at the war's start and has since vowed to extend its ground assault. Unable to go into north Gaza or neighboring Egypt, their only escape is to move around within the 85-square-mile area (220 square kilometers).Renewed hostilities also heighten concerns for about 140 hostages still held captive by Hamas and other militants, after more than 100 were freed during the truce. For families of remaining hostages, the truce’s collapse was a blow to hopes their loved ones could be the next out after days of seeing others freed. The Israeli army said Friday it had confirmed the deaths of four more hostages, bringing the total known dead to seven.Qatar, which has served as a mediator along with Egypt, said negotiators were still trying for a deal to restore the cease-fire. Israel and Hamas traded blame for ending the truce.Bombs are falling on Gaza again. Who are the hostages still remaining in the besieged strip?JERUSALEM (AP) — A weeklong cease-fire that brought the exchanges of dozens of hostages held by Hamas for scores of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel gave way Friday morning to resumed fighting between Israel and Hamas. As mediators scuttle between the warring sides in a last-ditch effort to broker another swap, questions emerge on who remains in captivity in the besieged enclave.Hamas and other militants seized around 247 hostages in their deadly Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed. Israel has pummeled the Gaza Strip in return, killing at least 13,300 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to health authorities in the Hamas-ruled territory.Here's a closer look at the fate of the hostages.Israel said on Friday that 136 hostages remain in Gaza. They include 119 men and 17 women and children, according to military spokesperson Daniel Hagari. Roughly 10 of the hostages are 75 and older, the Prime Minister's Office said Friday.The vast majority are Israeli while 11 are foreign nationals, including eight from Thailand, one from Nepal and Tanzania each, and one French-Mexican.House expels New York Rep. George Santos. It's just the sixth expulsion in the chamber's historyWASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted on Friday to expel Republican Rep. George Santos of New York after a blistering ethics report on his conduct heightened lawmakers' concerns about the scandal-plagued freshman. Santos became just the sixth member in the chamber's history to be ousted by colleagues, and the third since the Civil War.The vote to expel was 311-114, easily clearing the two-thirds majority required. House Republican leaders opposed removing Santos, whose departure leaves them with a razor-thin majority, but in the end 105 GOP lawmakers sided with nearly all Democrats to expel him.The expulsion marked the final congressional chapter in a spectacular fall from grace for Santos. Celebrated as an up-and-comer after he flipped a district from Democrats last year, Santos' life story began to unravel before he was even sworn into office. Reports emerged that he had lied about having Jewish ancestry, a career at top Wall Street firms and a college degree, among other things.Then, in May, Santos was indicted by federal prosecutors on multiple charges, turning his presence in the House into a growing distraction and embarrassment to the party.Santos joins a short list of lawmakers expelled from the House, and for reasons uniquely his own. Of the previous expulsions in the House, three were for siding with the Confederacy during the Civil War. The remaining two occurred after the lawmakers were convicted of crimes in federal court, the most recent in 2002.Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, has died at age 93WASHINGTON (AP) — Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, an unwavering voice of moderate conservatism and the first woman to serve on the nation’s highest court, died Friday. She was 93.O’Connor died in Phoenix, of complications related to advanced dementia and a respiratory illness, the Supreme Court said in a news release.Chief Justice John Roberts mourned her death. “A daughter of the American Southwest, Sandra Day O’Connor blazed an historic trail as our Nation’s first female Justice,"" Roberts said in statement issued by the court. “She met that challenge with undaunted determination, indisputable ability, and engaging candor.”In 2018, she announced that she had been diagnosed with “the beginning stages of dementia, probably Alzheimer’s disease.” Her husband, John O’Connor, died of complications of Alzheimer’s in 2009.O’Connor’s nomination in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan and subsequent confirmation by the Senate ended 191 years of male exclusivity on the high court. A native of Arizona who grew up on her family’s sprawling ranch, O’Connor wasted little time building a reputation as a hard worker who wielded considerable political clout on the nine-member court.Trump attorney says trial during campaign would be 'election interference' if he is GOP nomineeATLANTA (AP) — An attorney for former President Donald Trump said Friday it would amount to “election interference” if his client is the Republican nominee for president while on trial in Georgia in the months running up to the general election.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee opened the door for discussion on trial timing while considering requests by two of the former president's co-defendants to delay certain pretrial deadlines. But he said he didn't plan to make any immediate decisions on a trial date.District Attorney Fani Willis last month asked that all defendants remaining in the case — currently Trump and 14 others — be tried together beginning Aug. 5. Prosecutors have previously estimated it would take them four months to present their case, not including jury selection. That would mean the trial would be underway during the final months of the election campaign.“Can you imagine the notion of the Republican nominee for president not being able to to campaign for the presidency because he is, in some form or fashion, in a courtroom defending himself?” Sadow said during the Friday hearing, later adding, “That would be the most effective election interference in the history of the United States.”Prosecutor Nathan Wade rejected that idea.Inmate stabbed Derek Chauvin 22 times, charged with attempted murder, prosecutors sayAn incarcerated former gang member and FBI informant was charged Friday with attempted murder in the stabbing last week of ex-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin at a federal prison in Arizona.John Turscak stabbed Chauvin 22 times at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson and said he would've killed Chauvin had correctional officers not responded so quickly, federal prosecutors said.Turscak, serving a 30-year sentence for crimes committed while a member of the Mexican Mafia gang, told investigators he thought about attacking Chauvin for about a month because the former officer, convicted of murdering George Floyd, is a high-profile inmate, prosecutors said. Turscak later denied wanting to kill Chauvin, prosecutors said.Turscak is accused of attacking Chauvin with an improvised knife in the prison's law library around 12:30 p.m. on Nov. 24, the day after Thanksgiving. The Bureau of Prisons said employees stopped the attack and performed “life-saving measures.” Chauvin was taken to a hospital for treatment.Turscak told FBI agents interviewing him after the assault that he attacked Chauvin on Black Friday as a symbolic connection to the Black Lives Matter movement, which garnered widespread support in the wake of Floyd's death, and the “Black Hand” symbol associated with the Mexican Mafia, prosecutors said.Chicago and other northern US cities scramble to house migrants with coldest weather just aheadCHICAGO (AP) — Chicago is scrambling to house hundreds of asylum-seekers who are still sheltering on sidewalks, at police stations and at the city's busiest airport as the cold weather sets in and with winter just around the corner.The country's third-largest city announced a partnership with religious leaders this week to house 400 of the migrants in churches. But with nighttime temperatures dropping below freezing and chillier conditions still ahead, more than 1,000 were still living at police stations or at O'Hare International Airport as of Friday, according to the city dashboard.“As winter fast approaches, our need for greater collaboration and coordination grows. And that is why we are mobilizing Chicago’s faith community and our partners in the philanthropic community to meet this moment,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a news conference announcing the partnership.More than 23,000 asylum-seekers have been bused to Chicago from Texas since the start of the year, according to the city. Other Democratic-led cities are grappling with similar influxes, including Denver, Houston, Los Angeles and New York, which has received more than 120,000 asylum-seekers.Illinois announced this month that it would funnel an additional $160 million to help resettle migrants who arrive in Chicago, including $65 million to help the city build and operate two temporary shelters to avoid people sleeping out in the cold. On Friday, the state announced it would give an additional $4 million that will go toward feeding asylum-seekers in partnership with the Greater Chicago Food DepositoryA world away from the West Bank, Vermont shooting victims and their families face new grief and fearBURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Nearly a week after three college students of Palestinian descent were shot and seriously wounded while taking an evening walk, relatives of two of the victims have arrived in Vermont from the war-torn West Bank, grappling with a new reality that has shattered their lives and a place they thought was a safe haven.Elizabeth Price and her husband Ali Awartani flew in Wednesday just as their son, Hisham Awartani, underwent surgery. After the Israel-Hamas war erupted in early October, they decided it would be safer for Hisham to stay in the United States instead of coming home for the holidays.Now they don't know if he will ever walk again.""When my nephew came to this country to pursue his studies and when he came to stay with me for Thanksgiving in Burlington, Vermont, it never occurred to me that he may be victim to this type of violence,"" Awartani's uncle Rich Price said in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday. “And so I feel a sense of shame, I feel a sense of outrage, and it’s been a really difficult awakening to the fact that even here — even in this country, even in this town — that many of the risks that exist for my nephew and his friends in Palestine exist for them here.”Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad, all age 20 and attending colleges in the eastern U.S., were visiting Price and his family for the holiday break. The three have been friends since first grade at Ramallah Friends School, a private school in the West Bank. While they were out for a walk Saturday evening after a family birthday party, a man approached them and shot them without saying a word, they told police.AP Exclusive: America's Black attorneys general discuss race, politics and the justice systemBOSTON (AP) — The American legal system is facing a crisis of trust in communities around the country, with people of all races and across the political spectrum.For many, recent protests against police brutality called attention to longstanding discrepancies in the administration of justice. For others, criticism of perceived conflicts of interest in the judiciary, as well as aspersions cast by former President Donald Trump and others on the independence of judges and law enforcement, have further damaged faith in the rule of law among broad swaths of the public.Yet many Black attorneys understood the disparate impact the legal system can have on different communities long before the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police. Many pursued legal careers and entered that same system to improve it, with some rising to one of its most influential roles, the top enforcement official: attorney general.There is a record number of Black attorneys general, seven in total, serving today. Two Black attorneys, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have served as U.S. attorney general. And the vice president, Kamala Harris, was the first Black woman elected attorney general.In that same moment of increased representation, the U.S. is gripped by intense debates regarding justice, race and democracy. Black prosecutors have emerged as central figures litigating those issues, highlighting the achievements and limits of Black communal efforts to reform the justice system.Flu is on the rise while RSV infections may be peaking, US health officials sayNEW YORK (AP) — Flu is picking up steam while RSV lung infections that can hit kids and older people hard may be peaking, U.S. health officials said Friday.COVID-19, though, continues to cause the most hospitalizations and deaths among respiratory illnesses — about 15,000 hospitalizations and about 1,000 deaths every week, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency is also looking into reports of pneumonia outbreaks in children in two states, but Cohen said “there is no evidence"" that they are due to anything unusual.As for the flu season, seven states were reporting high levels of flu-like illnesses in early November. In a new CDC report on Friday, the agency said the tally was up to 11 states — mostly in the South and Southwest.In the last month, RSV infections rose sharply in some parts of the country, nearly filling hospital emergency departments in Georgia, Texas and some other states. But ""we think we’re near the peak of RSV season or will be in the next week or so,"" Cohen said.","{

Photograph: Kirsty O’Connor/PADrug resistanceAntibiotic-resistant infections rise in England but still below pre-Covid levelsNumber of antibiotic prescriptions also up and officials warn against giving leftovers to friends and family Nicola Davis Science correspondent@NicolaKSDavisTue 14 Nov 2023 19.01 ESTLast modified on Tue 14 Nov 2023 19.03 ESTGiving leftover antibiotics to friends and family risks fuelling a surge in infections resistant to the drugs, officials have warned, as data shows a rise in related cases in England – with people of Asian heritage at greater risk than those who are white.While severe antibiotic-resistant infections – such as bloodstream infections, UTIs, surgical site infections and respiratory infections – remained below 2018 levels last year, the latest estimates suggest there was a 4% rise between 2021 and 2022, from 55,792 to 58,224. The uptick follows a notable decline during the height of the Covid pandemic.There was also a rise in the number of deaths attributed to severe antibiotic-resistant infections, from 2,110 in 2021 to 2,202 in 2022.However, it appears the increases reflect a wider uptick in all infections since Covid restrictions were lifted, with data showing that the proportion of bloodstream infections resistant to one or more antibiotics has remained steady since 2018, at around one in five.Dr Colin Brown, the deputy director for antimicrobial resistance at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said the findings reflected a shift back towards pre-pandemic life.“We are probably returning to more usual healthcare utilisation, more usual complexity of services being offered, and more usual numbers of infections as people also go about more normal activity,” he said.“I think it’s a combination of those [factors] that is increasing the number of infections compared to what we saw during the core pandemic period, and that is subsequently increasing the number of resistant infections.”There are signs that at least some microbes involved in bloodstream infections are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, including the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and E coli.The report of the English surveillance programme for antimicrobial utilisation and resistance (Espaur) says there was an 8.4% increase in the number of prescriptions for antibiotics between 2021 and 2022. But the total is still below 2019 levels.Experts at UKHSA suggest the increase could reflect a rise in circulating infections – possibly as a result of decreased exposure and immunity during the peak of the pandemic – and a lowering of thresholds for prescribing antibiotics during situations such as the strep A outbreak last winter.The 2022 data shows that adults aged over 64 and infants under one year had the highest rate of antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections, while rates were also higher for more deprived communities.The proportion of bloodstream infections that were resistant to antibiotics was around twice as high for Asian or Asian British ethnic groups, at 34.6%, as for white ethnic groups, at 18.7%.“There is a likelihood that people with close community ties back and forth to countries where there are higher risks of drug resistance are more likely to have, in their communities, levels of greater drug resistance,” Brown said, although he added that further work was needed to test the hypothesis.The Espaur report says people with antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections have a 19% chance of dying over a 30-day period, compared with a 16% chance of death for those with a strain that is susceptible to antibiotics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such infections had been falling before the pandemic.Experts have stressed that inappropriate and excessive antibiotic use is a key driver of antibiotic resistance. While efforts are under way to reduce prescribing, they say there are also measures that everyone can take.“We can all take steps to prevent infections in the first instance,” said Prof Diane Ashiru-Oredope, the lead pharmacist for antimicrobial resistance at UKHSA.“And that can come through regular hand washing, keeping up to date with vaccinations, keeping rooms ventilated and staying away from vulnerable people if we’ve become unwell.”Ashiru-Oredope said it was also important only to take antimicrobials such as antibiotics if advised by a healthcare professional, stressing that the medications should not be shared with others. Experts have previously said sharing prescription drugs is illegal.“Antibiotics will not work for viruses such as cold, flu or Covid-19,” said Prof Jenny Harries, the UKHSA chief executive. “Treat antibiotics with respect and they will be there to help us all in the future.”Explore more on these topicsDrug resistanceAntibioticsHealthEnglandnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisUkraineFootballNewslettersBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Eduardo Soteras/AFP/Getty ImagesHealth and climateGlobal development‘Paying in lives’: health of billions at risk from global heating, warns reportInaction on the climate crisis is ‘costing lives and livelihoods’ due to extreme heat, food insecurity and infectious diseases, say scientistsSupported byAbout this contentSarah BoseleyTue 14 Nov 2023 18.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 14 Nov 2023 18.33 ESTThe climate crisis will have a catastrophic effect on the health and survival of billions of people unless the world acts to reduce global heating, according to a leading report that warns that heat-related deaths are soaring, dangerous bacteria are spreading along coasts, and economies are being hit as people struggle to work and food production shrinks.The eighth annual report on health and climate change from the Lancet Countdown team shows that little account has been taken of past warnings. The world, it says, is “moving in the wrong direction”, and strongly criticises continuing investment in fossil fuels.The report comes as Cop28 prepares to hold its first Health Day, focused on the links between the climate crisis and human health.The report says that 127 million more people were experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity in 2021, compared with the previous three decades, putting them at risk of malnutrition and irreversible health harm. Life-threatening diseases are spreading, including dengue, malaria and West Nile virus. Warmer seas have led to the coastal spread of the water-borne vibrio bacteria at the rate of an extra 204 miles (329km) a year since 1982, putting 1.4 billion people at risk of diarrhoeal disease, severe wound infections and sepsis. Exposure to air pollution - which is worsened by heatwaves – is increasing the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.Heat-related deaths among over-65s, who are more vulnerable, are up by 85% since the 1990s. Without the increase in global temperatures, such deaths would have increased as the population enlarges, but only by 38%. The highest global temperatures in more than 100,000 years were recorded in 2023, says the report.Even at the current 10-year mean heating of 1.14C above pre-industrial levels, there is a profound impact on the lives and health of people around the world. But, say the 114 experts from 52 research institutions and UN agencies, what we are seeing could just be early symptoms of the disaster to come.“Our health stocktake reveals that the growing hazards of climate change are costing lives and livelihoods worldwide today. Projections of a 2C hotter world reveal a dangerous future, and are a grim reminder that the pace and scale of mitigation efforts seen so far have been woefully inadequate to safeguard people’s health and safety,” said Dr Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown at University College London.“There is an enormous human cost to inaction, and we can’t afford this level of disengagement – we are paying in lives. Every moment we delay makes the path to a livable future more difficult and adaptation increasingly costly and challenging.”The value of economic losses resulting from extreme weather events was estimated at $264bn (£215bn) in 2022, 23% higher than in 2010-14.If temperatures rise by 2C, heat-related deaths will increase by 370% and the number of work hours lost will be up by 50% by mid-century, according to new projections from the Climate Vulnerable Forum of countries most at risk. By 2041-60, about 525 million people could be experiencing moderate to severe food insecurity, risking malnutrition.Riverside communities arrive to receive water and food during drought and extreme heat in Amazonas, Brazil, last month. Photograph: Edmar Barros/APUN secretary-general António Guterres said there was no excuse for delay. “We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding, with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks and deadly storms and floods,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Deaths from fossil fuel-derived air pollution have fallen 16% since 2005, with 80% of this decline owing to efforts to reduce pollution from coal burning. Global investment in clean energy grew 15% in 2022 to $1.6tn, exceeding fossil fuel investment by 61%. In 2022, 90% of the growth in electricity capacity was down to renewable energy.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentHealth and climateHealthClimate crisisExtreme weatherGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsFood securitynewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The October rate of pending home sales declined by 1.5% compared to September, marking the lowest figure ever recorded. One of the reasons for the decline is low supply and high mortgage rates aimed at curbing inflation. Despite declining rates, there is no indication of improvement in the inventory issue. However, markets with higher inventory levels are experiencing benefits. AFP photo NEW DELHI: Real estate in the US has been trapped in a state of abeyance as the housing market dips to record-low, resulting in a drop in pending home sales, reported the New York Post citing a report from the National Association of Realtors.According to the report, ""the US housing market has never moved so little"". In October, the rate of pending home sales saw a notable decline of 1.5% compared to September, marking the lowest figure ever recorded for this metric since its inception in 2001, according to the trade group's data.Additionally, the report highlighted an 8.5% year-over-year decrease in transactions across all four regions of the United States.One of the reasons being attributed to the decline is the ""low supply and languishing high mortgage rates"" aimed to curb inflation.“During October, mortgage rates were at their highest, and contract signings for existing homes were at their lowest in more than 20 years,” Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist told The Post.“Recent weeks’ successive declines in mortgage rates will help qualify more home buyers, but limited housing inventory is significantly preventing housing demand from fully being satisfied. Multiple offers, of course, yield only one winner, with the rest left to continue their search,"" Yun said.Despite the ongoing decline in rates, there is no indication of improvement in the inventory issue in the foreseeable future. However, markets with higher inventory levels are experiencing significant benefits from this situation.“Home sales are rising in places where more inventory is available,” Yun said. “Sales for properties priced above $750,000 were higher than a year ago because there is more inventory at this price point than what we saw last October,” he said.""Newly built home sales are also up year-over-year, by 4.5%,"" The Post reported. Yun said that it is crucial to persistently prioritize increasing housing supply through various measures in every part of the country in the months ahead.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

By the time he arrived at the emergency room, doctors told his mother that his lungs were full of fluid and his oxygen levels were dangerously low.“They said that if he went much lower it could have caused brain damage in some way,” Ms Campbell told DailyMail.com. “He was extremely scared.”William was exhibiting symptoms of what doctors would later diagnose as mycoplasma pneumonia, also known as “white lung syndrome,” a bacteria that can cause infections by damaging the lining of the respiratory system, according to the CDC.The illness has been deemed an outbreak in Warren County Heath District in Ohio due to the spiking cases in recent weeks. William is one of 145 pneumonia cases between the ages of three and 14 that have been reported since August.Ohio mother Mollee Campbell is speaking out about her son’s frightening pneumonia symptoms as cases spike in the state (Mollee Campbell/Facebook)Ms Campbell said that her local hospital was overwhelmed with cases of paediatric pneumonia and that paediatricians were struggling to treat the rising number of patients.“They said they were overloaded with it in the last two or three days that that was all they had been seeing and they were just trying to make sure they had all the medicine they needed for all the kids,” Ms Campbell told the Mail. “They did say almost the whole floor was nothing but children with pneumonia.”Mycoplasma pneumonia is the same strain at the centre of outbreaks in Denmark and China. However, Ohio health officials have insisted that the outbreak of pneumonia in the state is not linked to any viruses circulating in China.According to Ms Campbell, William went from showing mild signs of a cold to having his oxygen levels drop to 75per cent in the span of two days.The mother-of-two is now speaking out about her son’s frightening experience in hopes that other parents act swiftly if they suspect their children are experiencing the pneumonia strain.“Even when your kid just has a little cough and it doesn’t seem like a normal one, just to go ahead and take them no matter what, even if it is just to check,” Ms Campbell. “It was a nightmare and I wish I would have taken him a little bit sooner than waiting a day, but these days you can never tell with kids. If your child doesn’t feel right, just contact somebody.”The average person affected by the illness is eight years old. In Ohio, the Warren County Health District said most children have been experiencing symptoms such as cough, fever and fatigue.Other symptoms listed by the CDC include a sore throat and headaches. If a child under five contracts the illness, they could also experience sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, watery eyes, wheezing, vomiting and diarrhoea.The bacteria is spread through coughs and sneezes and is usually spread between people who spend a lot of time together, such as in households, schools, residence halls, and military or care facilities and hospitals. Once someone becomes infected, symptoms can appear after one to four weeks and usually last longer than typical pneumonia.The district said that the illnesses are not unusual and reported that no deaths have been recorded in relation to the outbreak. Health officials warned that the cases are not suspected to be a new respiratory illness, noting that it is “not uncommon” for respiratory illnesses to spread among communities during the colder months.Similar cases have been seen in China on a larger scale, with one Beijing children’s hospital telling state media CCTV that at least 7,000 patients were being admitted daily. Cases of mycoplasma pneumonia are also spreading in Denmark, reaching epidemic levels and recoding 541 new cases by the end of last week, according to a Danish Ministry of Health research group.Warren County Health District said that there has yet to be any evidence linking the Ohio outbreak to other surges, whether statewide, nationally or internationally.Health officials said that the uptick in cases in Warren County follows typical seasonal bacterial and viral activity trends.“There is zero evidence that what we’re seeing in Warren County has any connection to any respiratory activity in the state, in the country, or in the world,” Dr Clint Koenig, the medical director of Warren County Health District told ABC News.
